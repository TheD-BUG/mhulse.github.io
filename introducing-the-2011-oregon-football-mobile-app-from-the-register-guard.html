<p>Today we rolled out a new means of providing what we hope you consider to be our top-flight coverage of the Oregon football team, an iPhone app. <a href="http://bit.ly/2011DuckFootball">Here’s a link to the app in the Apple store</a>.</p>

<p>The R-G Oregon football app will be a one-stop resource for all of our coverage. Stories, blog posts, my Twitter feed, photos, videos — all of it can be accessed through the app.</p>

<p>We have pages dedicated to top UO stars like Darron Thomas, LaMichael James and Cliff Harris. We have full roster and statistical information, conference standings and a roundup of national college football news.</p>

<p>Among the features specific to the app are an area for fans to submit their favorites photos and news tips for consideration, weather and traffic updates for use on game days, and the deepest access to the R-G’s Oregon football archives available, deeper even than our website.</p>

<p>We hope you find it to be a valuable resource, and well worth a few bucks. And for those operating on an Android or Windows Mobile, stay tuned.</p>
