The R-G Oregon football app will be a one-stop resource for all of our coverage. Stories, blog posts, my Twitter feed, photos, videos — all of it can be accessed through the app. We have pages dedicated to top UO stars like Darron Thomas, LaMichael James and Cliff Harris. We have full roster and statistical information, conference standings and a roundup of national college football news. Among the features specific to the app are an area for fans to submit their favorites photos and news tips for consideration, weather and traffic updates for use on game days, and the deepest access to the R-G’s Oregon football archives available, deeper even than our website. We hope you find it to be a valuable resource, and well worth a few bucks. And for those operating on an Android or Windows Mobile, stay tuned. – Original article by Rob Moseley App version links: iOS, Android and Windows Phone 7.

A view from the boat on the way to Alcatraz island. A view from the boat on the way to Alcatraz island. Alcatraz’s guard towers and catwalks were installed in 1934 – the Federal Penitentiary’s first year in operation. Heavily armed guards kept watch from this tower, plus five others, and a system of catwalks that loomed over the Rock. [Infrared HDRI] Built in 1857, the guardhouse is the oldest building on the island. It was the first line of defense against landing parties which would have to enter the building and cross a drawbridge across a 15 foot moat. [Infrared HDRI] From around 1850-1930, the island was occupied by soldiers and their families. The Post Exchange sold food and goods and included a bowling alley and gym. Prior to a consuming fire in 1970, the Exchange was used as a club / recreation hall for the prison guards.

End of the 4th quarter: Along the Duck sidelines. Duck fans! Binaural recording. Recorded using R-09 and MM-BSM-8 (Sennheiser version). GPS tracks of my trip recorded using AMOD GPS Photo Tracker AGL3080. Notes to self: Wear better shoes (tennis shoes are a must)! A week later and my toes are still numb!!! This Shure SM58 mic saved the handheld camera audio! Next time: Put an SM58 on both cameras and record into both audio channels rather than splitting right and left channels between the SM58 and the Rode NTG-1 Condenser Shotgun Microphone (NTG-1 was next to useless). Use auto audio levels (this turns on AGC on the A1). NEED SHOULDER MOUNT! Currently, the Spiderbrace (with LANC or LANC or LANC) looks like a good pick (with this modification). Others: Adorama Shoulder Support, DvRig Junior. Shoot wider and play with zoom/focus less often. Watch the more experienced photogs and follow their lead. Don’t be overly ambitious; leave all the “extra” equipment at home. Ditch the heavy wide angle lens. Make sure RG reserves a spot for the secondary camera in the press box camera area. Get establishing shot when there are actually large groups of people outside of the stadium! Use auto white balance; I white balanced too early in the day and did not have time to fix later. Take more photos with my P&amp;S (otherwise, leave it at home). Shoot in 30F (30p) instead of 24F (24p) mode.

				<div class="off">June 11, 2010 | The event source for Lane County: Logo variations. Arts events calendar “go” is online The newsroom last week began to beta launch a new “go” entertainment events site at registerguard.com. The idea for this project has been to capture content into a live, searchable database—a community calendar of events online—that news can then reverse publish to the print edition without a lot of duplicated effort. The concept is that news sources and eventually community members can upload information themselves without news aides, reporters or editors having to generate it. Deputy Managing Editor Carl Davaz has headed up the project. “A big round of applause for John Heasly and Micky Hulse for working so hard and creatively over the past few months to make this project come together” Carl said. “Thanks also to Lisa Crossley, Steve Collier and Mark Johnson as we’ve tried to leverage their ideas and preserve their calendar workflow.” The intention throughout the project has been to connect the community with this calendar. Initial meetings with Arts &amp; Business Alliance leaders helped to refine the concept. Arts organizations around the city have begun to participate in the process by using the direct conduit to contribute content. The editors feel there’s been a lot of enthusiasm. First tier contributors will be able upload events via spreadsheets and enhance calendar entries with expanded descriptions, including images and embedded video and audio. “Go Entertainment” is available under the Entertainment menu at registerguard.com or by entering the address registerguard.com/go. “Visually it’s a pretty simple design” Carl explains. “Featured entertainment events attract attention. Visitors can search for events in several ways. You can search by category at the top of the page. You can search by date on the widget or the calendar. The widget can be shared with other sites. And you can search by venue at the bottom of the page.” Other content includes latest blog posts, limited recent entertainment/arts stories and reviews from the print edition. Non-Flash picture presentations are viewable on any mobile device. It will be an advertising-supported site, but to limit clutter for visitors and provide the best environment for advertisers, we’re limiting the ads to two online standard ad units, the leaderboard and box ad. Next phases of development will focus on a new mobile presentation format and the addition of other features like supplementing entries with Facebook commenting. Ultimately, “go” will have a broader mission to include events other than entertainment, such as community events, sports, business—really anything that readers will want to know about and go to.

Cameras (finally) in Lane County courts By Carl Davaz Register-Guard photographers Kevin Clark and Chris Pietsch made history on March 12 when they became the first still photographers permitted to take photographs during Lane County courtroom hearings. The newspaper had been trying to gain “cameras in the courtroom” access in Lane County for decades. Despite the Oregon Supreme Court’s 1999 adoption of revisions to the state’s Uniform Trial Court Rules permitting still and video cameras in courtrooms, Lane County judges continued to bar the use of still cameras. That changed on March 11 when Director of Graphics Rob Romig submitted a request to the Lane County Circuit Court to photograph three hearings, one pertaining to a murder case and two others involving University of Oregon football players. The Register-Guard photographers were designated as the pool still photographers, Clark for the Richard McAnulty hearing and Pietsch for both the LaMichael James and Jeremiah Masoli hearings. KVAL was designated to coordinate the video pool. “Pool” responsibilities require that the designated photographers provide other media with still photographs or video. The photographers, along with news and sports reporters and the Web team’s Micky Hulse, handling video from KVAL, filed live breaking news updates through the day at registerguard.com.</div>
