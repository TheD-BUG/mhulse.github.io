### On the Pacific Crest Trail

[Follow Bob Welch’s 452-mile trek through Oregon](http://assets.registerguard.com/packages/pct-oregon-2011/) on [registerguard.com](http://www.registerguard.com/) Aug. 28 through Sept. 7. Nearly 20 miles a day. Crazy? Of course. But what else would you expect from bob?
