### Notes to self:

* I will never, EVER, use the [XHA1](http://www.usa.canon.com/app/html/HDV/XHA1/) “auto gain” ever ever **EVER** again!
* Trust my first instincts for camera and exposure settings.
* Film more football games … Um, practice makes perfect. (This was my first time filming college football event, and a night one at that!)
* Bring [6 pin to 4 pin firewire cable](http://snipurl.com/tk4tg).
* Arrive earlier … Traffic was a bitch.
* Buy zoom lens. 10 more X would have been nice.
* Use a video camera that records to memory cards instead of tape.
* Force myself to use manual focus ALL OF THE TIME (but have my thumb on the “push auto focus” button, just in case.)
* Figure out a way to get better audio … The [AKG Perception 170](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/558998-REG/AKG_3101_H_00070_Perception_170_Small.html) would have been nice to have.
* Bring a [Steady Stick](http://www.tiffen.com/SteadyStick.htm). The mono-pod just got in the way.
