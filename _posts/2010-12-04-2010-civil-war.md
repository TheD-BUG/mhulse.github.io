[GPS tracks of my trip](http://www.everytrail.com/view_trip.php?trip_id=903917&code=8838fb3fc26dc03c8e590d1da0a8c0f3) recorded using [AMOD GPS Photo Tracker AGL3080](http://www.amod.com.tw/Product/product_more.asp?vrlShohLe7iBxJO2wrpSmKWodZm2ybZ1obS8uLqHgKW9wMmEdamHtriAusd).

### Notes to self:

* Wear better shoes (tennis shoes are a must)! A week later and my toes are still numb!!!
* This [Shure SM58](http://www.shure.com/americas/products/microphones/sm/sm58-vocal-microphone) mic saved the handheld camera audio! Next time: Put an SM58 on both cameras and record into both audio channels rather than splitting right and left channels between the SM58 and the [Rode NTG-1 Condenser Shotgun Microphone](http://www.rodemic.com/microphones/ntg-1) (NTG-1 was next to useless).
* Use **auto** audio levels (this turns on AGC on the A1).
* **NEED SHOULDER MOUNT!** Currently, the [Spiderbrace](http://www.spiderbrace.com/) (with [LANC](http://www.amazon.com/Function-Remote-Control-ZR-1000-ZR-2000/dp/B002SQLYV8) or [LANC](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/bnh/controller/home?O=cart_accessories&A=details&Q=&sku=330007&is=REG) or [LANC](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/361366-REG/Libec_ZC_3DV.html)) looks like a good pick (with [this modification](http://www.dvinfo.net/forum/shoulder-handheld-supports/434734-shoulder-mount-xha1.html)). Others: [Adorama Shoulder Support](http://www.adorama.com/FACSS.html?emailprice=t&utm_term=Other&utm_medium=Affiliate&utm_campaign=Other&utm_source=rflaid65067), [DvRig Junior](http://www.dvtec.tv/id3.html).
* Shoot wider and play with zoom/focus less often.
* Watch the more experienced photogs and follow their lead.
* Don’t be overly ambitious; leave all the “extra” equipment at home.
* Ditch the heavy wide angle lens.
* Make sure RG reserves a spot for the secondary camera in the press box camera area.
* Get establishing shot when there are actually large groups of people outside of the stadium!
* Use auto white balance; I white balanced too early in the day and did not have time to fix later.
* Take more photos with my P&S (otherwise, leave it at home).
* Shoot in 30F (30p) instead of 24F (24p) mode.
