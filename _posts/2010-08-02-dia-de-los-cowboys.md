### Inspiration:

[This book](http://www.amazon.com/Puro-Muerto-Spanish-LaMono-Press/dp/0972473521) and an old photograph of my great grandpa (I think he's second from right in picture in above photograph) and his three friends.

### Factoids:

* About halfway through this drawing I felt compeled to check my proportions with several sheets of “gridded” transparency, combined to create a 20" X 23" grid, taped to original photograph.
* At the time that I added the grid I also converted the bit depth to 16; I was amazed to see the difference in file size: 65.5 MB vs. 629.4 MB. The document size of the final version: 1.12 GB.
* For the majority of this `7800px` x `9000px` illustration I used a `3px` brush tip.
