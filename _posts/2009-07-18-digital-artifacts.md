This was my first introduction to [Macs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh) ([OS 7.6-ish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Mac_OS#Mac_OS_7.6)), [ClarisWorks](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/bob/clarisworks.php) & an _early_ version of [Photoshop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop).

From what I can remember, all three (especially “Megan”) were created using just (or, mostly) the [pencil](http://www.schools.ash.org.au/revesby/cwtls.html) [tool](http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/evolution-of-photoshop/).
